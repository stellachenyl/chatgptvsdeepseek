### ChatGPT Answer

We want to prove by mathematical induction that for all positive integers n, the following holds:

d^n/dx^n (arctan(x)) = P_n(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-n)

where P_n(x) is a polynomial of degree n-1.

Step 1: Base Case
Start by proving the statement for n = 1.

For n = 1, we have:

d/dx (arctan(x))

We know the derivative of arctan(x) is:

d/dx (arctan(x)) = 1 / (1 + x^2)

Thus, the statement holds for n = 1 with:

P_1(x) = 1

and

d^1/dx^1 (arctan(x)) = P_1(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-1)

Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis
Assume that the statement holds for some n = k. That is, we assume:

d^k/dx^k (arctan(x)) = P_k(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-k)

where P_k(x) is a polynomial of degree k - 1.

Step 3: Inductive Step
We now prove that the statement holds for n = k + 1.

To do this, we differentiate both sides of the inductive hypothesis:

d^(k+1)/dx^(k+1) (arctan(x)) = d/dx (P_k(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-k))

Using the product rule, we get:

d/dx (P_k(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-k)) = P_k'(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-k) + P_k(x) * d/dx ((1 + x^2)^(-k))

Next, differentiate (1 + x^2)^(-k) using the chain rule:

d/dx ((1 + x^2)^(-k)) = -k * (1 + x^2)^(-k-1) * 2x

Thus, we have:

d^(k+1)/dx^(k+1) (arctan(x)) = P_k'(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-k) - 2kx * P_k(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-k-1)

Now, observe that the degree of the polynomial P_k'(x) is k - 1, and P_k(x) is a polynomial of degree k - 1. Therefore, the term P_k'(x) is of degree k - 2, and the term P_k(x) is of degree k - 1. Thus, the entire expression on the right-hand side is a polynomial of degree k, and the form matches that of P_(k+1)(x).

Thus, we have:

d^(k+1)/dx^(k+1) (arctan(x)) = P_(k+1)(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-(k+1))

where P_(k+1)(x) is a polynomial of degree k.

Step 4: Conclusion
By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that the given formula holds for all positive integers n:

d^n/dx^n (arctan(x)) = P_n(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-n)

where P_n(x) is a polynomial of degree n - 1.

### DeepSeek Thinking

Okay, I need to prove by induction that the nth derivative of arctan x is equal to P_n(x) times (1 + x²)^-n, where P_n is a polynomial of degree n-1. Hmm, let's start by recalling how induction works. First, the base case: n=1. Then, assume it's true for some k, and show it holds for k+1.

Base case n=1: The first derivative of arctan x is 1/(1 + x²). Let's check. The derivative of arctan x is indeed 1/(1 + x²). So here, P_1(x) is 1, which is a polynomial of degree 0 (since 1 = x^0), which matches n-1 = 0. So the base case works.

Inductive step: Assume that for some integer k ≥ 1, the kth derivative of arctan x is P_k(x)/(1 + x²)^k, where P_k is a polynomial of degree k-1. Now, we need to show that the (k+1)th derivative is P_{k+1}(x)/(1 + x²)^{k+1}, where P_{k+1} is degree k.

To find the (k+1)th derivative, take the derivative of the kth derivative. So d/dx [P_k(x)/(1 + x²)^k]. Use the quotient rule or product rule. Let's use the product rule. Let me write it as P_k(x) * (1 + x²)^{-k}.

The derivative will be P_k'(x) * (1 + x²)^{-k} + P_k(x) * derivative of (1 + x²)^{-k}.

Compute each term. First term: P_k'(x) is a polynomial of degree k-2 (since differentiating a degree k-1 polynomial gives degree k-2). Then multiplied by (1 + x²)^{-k}.

Second term: derivative of (1 + x²)^{-k} is -k * 2x * (1 + x²)^{-k -1}. So we have P_k(x) * (-2k x) * (1 + x²)^{-k -1}.

But let's factor out (1 + x²)^{-k -1} from both terms. Let me see:

First term: P_k'(x) * (1 + x²)^{-k} = P_k'(x) * (1 + x²) * (1 + x²)^{-k -1}

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, express both terms over the same denominator.

First term: [P_k'(x) * (1 + x²) ] / (1 + x²)^{k +1}

Second term: [ -2k x P_k(x) ] / (1 + x²)^{k +1}

So combining the two, the numerator is P_k'(x)(1 + x²) - 2k x P_k(x). Let's call this Q(x) = P_k'(x)(1 + x²) - 2k x P_k(x). Then the (k+1)th derivative is Q(x)/(1 + x²)^{k +1}.

Now, we need to check that Q(x) is a polynomial of degree k. Since P_k(x) is degree k-1, P_k'(x) is degree k-2. Multiply by (1 + x²) which is degree 2, so the first term is degree (k-2) + 2 = k. The second term: -2k x P_k(x). P_k(x) is degree k-1, so multiplying by x gives degree k, and then times a constant. So both terms in Q(x) are degree k. So Q(x) is a polynomial of degree k. Therefore, P_{k+1}(x) = Q(x) is a polynomial of degree k, which is (k+1)-1 = k. So that works.

Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.

Wait, but let me verify this step again. If P_k(x) is degree k-1, then P_k'(x) is degree k-2. Then multiplied by (1 + x²), which is quadratic, so the term becomes degree (k-2) + 2 = k. Then the other term is -2k x times P_k(x) which is degree (k-1) +1 = k. So both terms are degree k. Therefore, Q(x) is degree k. The leading terms might cancel, but unless they do, the degree is k. But even if leading terms cancel, the degree is at most k, but we need to confirm that the degree is exactly k.

Wait, but in the inductive step, do we need to ensure that the resulting polynomial P_{k+1} has degree exactly k, not less? Hmm. Suppose that when combining the two terms, the leading terms might cancel. Is that possible?

Let me think. Let's consider P_k(x) as a polynomial of degree k-1. Let me denote P_k(x) = a_{k-1}x^{k-1} + ... + a_0. Then P_k'(x) = (k-1)a_{k-1}x^{k-2} + ... + a_1. Multiply by (1 + x²): the highest degree term is (k-1)a_{k-1}x^{k-2} * x² = (k-1)a_{k-1}x^{k}. The other term in Q(x) is -2k x * P_k(x) = -2k x*(a_{k-1}x^{k-1} + ...) = -2k a_{k-1}x^{k} + ... So combining these two terms in Q(x):

First term's leading term: (k-1)a_{k-1}x^{k}

Second term's leading term: -2k a_{k-1}x^{k}

Total leading term: [ (k -1) - 2k ] a_{k-1}x^{k} = (-k -1) a_{k-1}x^{k}

Unless a_{k-1} is zero, which it isn't (since P_k(x) is degree k-1), then the leading term is non-zero. Therefore, the degree of Q(x) is exactly k. So P_{k+1}(x) has degree k, which is (k+1)-1. Therefore, the inductive step holds.

Therefore, the induction is valid. Thus, the statement is proven.

### DeepSeek Answer

Prove by mathematical induction that for all positive integers n,

d^n/dx^n (arctan x) = P_n(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-n)

where P_n(x) is a polynomial of degree n-1.

--- Base Case (n = 1) ---
First derivative:
d/dx (arctan x) = 1/(1 + x^2)

Here, P_1(x) = 1 (degree 1-1 = 0). Base case holds.

--- Inductive Step ---
Assume for n = k:
d^k/dx^k (arctan x) = P_k(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-k)
where P_k(x) is a polynomial of degree k-1.

Goal: Show for n = k+1:
d^(k+1)/dx^(k+1) (arctan x) = P_(k+1)(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-(k+1))
where P_(k+1)(x) has degree k.

--- Proof ---
1. Differentiate the k-th derivative:
   d/dx [P_k(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-k)] = P_k'(x) * (1 + x^2)^(-k) + P_k(x) * d/dx[(1 + x^2)^(-k)]

2. Compute derivatives:
   - P_k'(x) is a polynomial of degree (k-1) - 1 = k-2
   - d/dx[(1 + x^2)^(-k)] = -2k * x * (1 + x^2)^(-k-1)

3. Substitute:
   d^(k+1)/dx^(k+1) (arctan x) = P_k'(x)*(1 + x^2)^(-k) - 2k*x*P_k(x)*(1 + x^2)^(-k-1)

4. Factor out (1 + x^2)^(-k-1):
   = [P_k'(x)*(1 + x^2) - 2k*x*P_k(x)] * (1 + x^2)^(-k-1)

5. Define P_(k+1)(x) = P_k'(x)*(1 + x^2) - 2k*x*P_k(x):
   - Term 1: P_k'(x)*(1 + x^2) has degree (k-2) + 2 = k
   - Term 2: -2k*x*P_k(x) has degree (k-1) + 1 = k
   - No cancellation of leading terms ⇒ P_(k+1)(x) has degree k

--- Conclusion ---
By induction, for all positive integers n:
d^n/dx^n (arctan x) = P_n(x)*(1 + x^2)^(-n)
where P_n(x) is a polynomial of degree n-1.
