## Question 5a

Show that the curve with Cartesian equation (x^2 + y^2)^2 = 6xy has polar equation r^2 = 3 sin 2t.

### Prompt

Show that the curve with Cartesian equation (x^2 + y^2)^2 = 6xy has polar equation r^2 = 3 sin 2t.

### ChatGPT Answer

We are given the Cartesian equation of a curve:

(x^2 + y^2)^2 = 6xy

and we need to show that its corresponding polar equation is:

r^2 = 3 sin(2θ)

Step 1: Express the Cartesian coordinates in terms of polar coordinates.
Recall the following relations between Cartesian and polar coordinates:

x = r * cos(θ)
y = r * sin(θ)
We can also express the squared distance from the origin as:

x^2 + y^2 = r^2
Step 2: Substitute polar coordinates into the Cartesian equation.
Now, substitute x = r * cos(θ) and y = r * sin(θ) into the given equation:

(x^2 + y^2)^2 = 6xy

First, simplify both sides:

On the left-hand side:

(x^2 + y^2)^2 = r^4

On the right-hand side:

6xy = 6 * (r * cos(θ)) * (r * sin(θ)) = 6r^2 * cos(θ) * sin(θ)

Thus, the equation becomes:

r^4 = 6r^2 * cos(θ) * sin(θ)

Step 3: Simplify the equation.
Divide both sides of the equation by r^2 (assuming r ≠ 0):

r^2 = 6 * cos(θ) * sin(θ)

Step 4: Use the double-angle identity.
Recall the double-angle identity for sine:

sin(2θ) = 2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ)

So, we can rewrite the equation as:

r^2 = 3 * sin(2θ)
We have shown that the Cartesian equation (x^2 + y^2)^2 = 6xy corresponds to the polar equation:

r^2 = 3 * sin(2θ)

Thus, the conversion is verified.

### DeepSeek Answer

To show that the curve with Cartesian equation (x² + y²)² = 6xy has the polar equation r² = 3 sin 2t, follow these steps:

Convert Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates:

Use the substitutions x = r cos t and y = r sin t.

The left side of the equation, (x² + y²)², becomes (r²)² = r⁴.

The right side, 6xy, becomes 6*(r cos t)*(r sin t) = 6r² cos t sin t.

Substitute into the original equation:

Replace (x² + y²)² and 6xy with their polar forms: r⁴ = 6r² cos t sin t.

Simplify the equation:

Divide both sides by r² (assuming r ≠ 0): r² = 6 cos t sin t.

Apply the double-angle identity for sine:

Use sin 2t = 2 sin t cos t. Then, 6 cos t sin t = 3*(2 sin t cos t) = 3 sin 2t.

Substitute this into the equation: r² = 3 sin 2t.

Verify the origin (r = 0):

In the Cartesian equation, r = 0 (origin) satisfies both sides (0 = 0).

In the polar equation, r² = 3 sin 2t, r = 0 implies sin 2t = 0. This holds for t = nπ/2 (consistent with the origin in Cartesian coordinates).

Check symmetries:

The Cartesian equation is symmetric under swapping x and y (line y = x) and inversion through the origin. These symmetries align with the polar equation’s dependence on sin 2t, which repeats every π radians and is symmetric under t → π/2 - t.

Thus, the polar equation of the curve is r² = 3 sin 2t.

## Question 5b

The curve C has polar equation r^2 = 3 sin 2theta, for 0 <= theta <= pi/2. State the maximum distance of a point on C from the pole.

### ChatGPT Answer

We are given the polar equation of the curve C:

r^2 = 3 sin(2θ)

for 0 <= θ <= π/2, and we need to find the maximum distance of a point on C from the pole.

Step 1: Find the expression for r.
From the given equation r^2 = 3 sin(2θ), we can solve for r:

r = √(3 sin(2θ))

Step 2: Maximize the value of r.
The distance r is maximized when sin(2θ) is maximized. The sine function reaches its maximum value of 1 when 2θ = π/2, or equivalently when θ = π/4.

Step 3: Calculate the maximum value of r.
Substitute θ = π/4 into the equation for r:

r^2 = 3 sin(2 × π/4) = 3 sin(π/2) = 3

Thus, r = √3.

### DeepSeek Answer

To find the maximum distance of a point on the curve r² = 3 sin 2theta (for 0 <= theta <= pi/2) from the pole (origin):

Express r in terms of theta:
r = sqrt(3 sin 2theta). Since r >= 0, we use the positive root.

Maximize r:
r is largest when sin 2theta is largest. The maximum value of sin 2theta is 1, which occurs at 2theta = pi/2 (theta = pi/4) within the interval 0 <= theta <= pi/2.

Calculate r at theta = pi/4:
Substitute theta = pi/4:
r² = 3 sin(pi/2) = 3 * 1 = 3, so r = sqrt(3).

Check theta = 0 and theta = pi/2:
At these points, sin 2theta = 0, so r = 0. These are the minimum distances.

The maximum distance from the pole is sqrt(3).

### Verdict

Both correct.
