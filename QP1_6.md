## Question 6a

The curve C has equation y = (4x^2 + x + 1)/(2x^2 - 7x + 3).

Find the equations of the asymptotes of C.

### ChatGPT Answer

To find the equations of the asymptotes of the curve given by:

y = (4x^2 + x + 1) / (2x^2 - 7x + 3)

we need to consider both the vertical asymptotes (when the denominator is zero) and the oblique or horizontal asymptotes (for large values of x).

1. Vertical Asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function equals zero, and the numerator is non-zero at those points.

We find the vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator equal to zero:

2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

x = (-(-7) ± √((-7)^2 - 4(2)(3))) / 2(2)

x = (7 ± √(49 - 24)) / 4

x = (7 ± √25) / 4

x = (7 ± 5) / 4

Thus, the two solutions are:

x = (7 + 5) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3

x = (7 - 5) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2

So, the vertical asymptotes are at:

x = 3 and x = 1/2

2. Oblique or Horizontal Asymptotes
For horizontal or oblique asymptotes, we need to examine the behavior of the function as x → ∞ or x → -∞.

Horizontal Asymptote:
If the degree of the numerator and denominator are the same, the horizontal asymptote is given by the ratio of the leading coefficients.

In this case, both the numerator and denominator are quadratic polynomials, and the leading coefficient of the numerator is 4, while the leading coefficient of the denominator is 2. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is:

y = 4 / 2 = 2

Conclusion:
The equations of the asymptotes for the curve are:

Vertical asymptotes: x = 3 and x = 1/2
Horizontal asymptote: y = 2

### DeepSeek Answer

To find the equations of the asymptotes for the curve C given by y = (4x^2 + x + 1)/(2x^2 - 7x + 3):

Vertical Asymptotes:

Factor the denominator: 2x^2 - 7x + 3 = (2x - 1)(x - 3).

The denominator equals zero when 2x - 1 = 0 or x - 3 = 0, giving x = 1/2 and x = 3.

Check the numerator at these x-values:

At x = 1/2: Numerator = 4*(1/2)^2 + (1/2) + 1 = 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 2.5 ≠ 0.

At x = 3: Numerator = 4*(3)^2 + 3 + 1 = 36 + 3 + 1 = 40 ≠ 0.

Since the numerator is non-zero at both x = 1/2 and x = 3, these are vertical asymptotes.

Horizontal Asymptote:

The degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal (both degree 2).

The horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients: 4/2 = 2.

Horizontal asymptote: y = 2.

Oblique Asymptotes:

Oblique (slant) asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is exactly one greater than the denominator. Here, the degrees are equal, so there are no oblique asymptotes.

Holes:

Check for common factors in the numerator and denominator.

The numerator 4x^2 + x + 1 does not factor further (it has no real roots) and shares no common factors with the denominator (2x - 1)(x - 3). Thus, there are no holes.

Equations of the asymptotes:

Vertical asymptotes: x = 1/2 and x = 3

Horizontal asymptote: y = 2

Final answer:
x = 1/2, x = 3, and y = 2.
