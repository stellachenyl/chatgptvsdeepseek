# Summary

## Question 1

Question 1a Summary: The problem required finding the matrix M representing a stretch parallel to the x-axis (scale factor k) followed by a shear keeping the x-axis fixed. ChatGPT incorrectly multiplied the stretch and shear matrices, resulting in a matrix with k squared. DeepSeek correctly identified the stretch matrix (k, 0 in the first row; 0, 1 in the second row) and shear matrix (1, k in the first row; 0, 1 in the second row), then multiplied them in the correct order (shear after stretch) to get M as a matrix with first row k, k and second row 0, 1. DeepSeek earned full marks.

Question 1b Summary: The task was to find the line of invariant points under M. Using its incorrect matrix from 1a, ChatGPT derived an equation involving k squared. DeepSeek used the correct matrix and solved the invariance condition, leading to the line equation y equals (1 minus k divided by k) times x. DeepSeek earned full marks, while ChatGPT received none.

Question 1c Summary: The question requires finding the matrix that transforms the parallelogram P back onto the unit square S, given the transformation matrix M. Both ChatGPT and DeepSeek correctly identify that finding the inverse of M is the key to solving this. ChatGPT calculates the inverse using the standard formula for a 2x2 matrix and arrives at the wrong inverse matrix: [[1/k, -k], [0, k]]. DeepSeek correctly computes the inverse matrix and verifies the result by multiplying M with its inverse to confirm it gives the identity matrix. DeepSeek’s solution is clearer, with a more thorough explanation and verification steps, ultimately providing the final result: [[1/k, -1], [0, 1]].

Question 1d Summary: This question asks for the possible values of k given that the area of the parallelogram P is 3k^2. Both ChatGPT and DeepSeek correctly identify that the area of P is related to the determinant of matrix M. ChatGPT finds the determinant of M and sets up the equation |k| = 3k^2 to solve for k. It solves the equation and provides k = 0, 1/3, and -1/3 as possible values. However, ChatGPT does not explain why k ≠ 0, which could lead to some ambiguity. DeepSeek, in contrast, goes into more detail, explaining both cases (k ≥ 0 and k < 0) and verifies the solutions. It provides the same values for k (1/3 and -1/3) and clarifies that both values are valid since the problem does not explicitly rule out negative k. DeepSeek provides a clearer and more detailed solution overall.

## Question 2

Both ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 successfully proved by induction that for all positive integers n, the n-th derivative of arctan(x) equals P_n(x)(1 + x²)^-n, where P_n(x) is a polynomial of degree n-1: the base case (n=1) showed d/dx(arctan x) = 1/(1 + x²) with P_1(x) = 1 (degree 0), the inductive hypothesis assumed validity for n=k (d^k/dx^k(arctan x) = P_k(x)(1 + x²)^-k), and the inductive step for n=k+1 derived d^(k+1)/dx^(k+1)(arctan x) by differentiating P_k(x)(1 + x²)^-k via product/chain rules, yielding P_{k+1}(x) = [P_k’(x)(1 + x²) – 2k x P_k(x)] (a polynomial of degree k), thus confirming the form P_{k+1}(x)(1 + x²)^-(k+1). Both models demonstrated rigorous logic, with DeepSeek providing marginally deeper algebraic detail, though they scored equally (6/6), validating the induction proof.

## Question 3

Question 3a Summary: The problem involves finding a new quartic equation with roots a^4, b^4, c^4, d^4, given the original quartic equation x^4 + 2x^3 - 1 = 0 with roots a, b, c, d, and computing the sum a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4. ChatGPT approached the problem by using Vieta's formulas and substituting r^4 = 1 - 2r^3 for each root, correctly calculating a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 20. However, ChatGPT made errors in intermediate symmetric sum calculations and derived the quartic equation x^4 - 20x^3 + 24x^2 + 1 = 0. In contrast, DeepSeek applied Vieta's formulas and Newton's identities systematically, computed power sums such as a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = -8, and correctly found a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 20. DeepSeek then built the correct quartic equation x^4 - 20x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0. The key result is that a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 20, and the correct quartic equation is x^4 - 20x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0. While ChatGPT provided correct initial logic, DeepSeek's solution was more rigorous and free from intermediate errors.

Question 3b Summary: The problem asks to find the value of a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + d^5, where a, b, c, and d are the roots of the quartic equation x^4 + 2x^3 - 1 = 0. Using the fact that each root satisfies the equation r^4 = 1 - 2r^3, we derived that r^5 = r - 2 + 4r^3. Summing this expression for all roots, we get a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + d^5 = (a + b + c + d) - 8 + 4(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3). From Vieta’s relations, we know a + b + c + d = -2 and a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = -8, so substituting these values into the equation gives a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + d^5 = -42. This result was confirmed through multiple approaches, including using recurrence relations and Newton's identities, making the final answer -42. In terms of performance, both ChatGPT and DeepSeek were able to derive the correct value of -42, though their methods differed. ChatGPT took a more straightforward approach by manipulating the equation for r^5 and summing over all roots, while DeepSeek also used recurrence relations and Newton's identities to compute the necessary power sums. Both systems ultimately arrived at the same result, indicating that they are both capable of solving the problem accurately, but they may employ different problem-solving techniques.

Question 3c Summary: Both ChatGPT and DeepSeek correctly computed the value of a^8 + b^8 + c^8 + d^8, arriving at the final answer of 388. ChatGPT provided a detailed step-by-step solution that involved expressing the higher powers of the roots in terms of lower powers and using Vieta’s relations to simplify the calculations. DeepSeek followed a similar approach, beginning with the given quartic equation, squaring it to find x^8, and then using known sums of powers of the roots to compute the desired result. Despite differences in their presentation, both methods were accurate, earning them equal scores for this task.

## Question 4

Question 4a summary: DeepSeek's solution was correct, and ChatGPT made an error in its approach. The mistake in ChatGPT's solution occurred during the partial fraction decomposition step, where the coefficients A and B were calculated incorrectly. This error led to an invalid decomposition, which caused the subsequent steps, including the telescoping sum, to produce an incorrect result. DeepSeek, on the other hand, derived the correct partial fraction decomposition and accurately simplified the telescoping sum, resulting in the correct expression: k / (5 + k) - k / (5(n + 1) + k). This highlights that while ChatGPT provided detailed steps, its calculations were flawed, whereas DeepSeek successfully maintained accuracy throughout.

Question 4b summary: Question 4b relies on the solution to 4a, as it uses the telescoping method required in CIE A-level mathematics. ChatGPT was unable to solve 4a and therefore could not proceed to solve 4b. In contrast, DeepSeek solved 4a correctly and applied the result to solve 4b accurately. By setting k divided by (5 + k) equal to 1/3, DeepSeek derived k = 5/2, which is the correct answer. This demonstrates that DeepSeek provided the correct and complete solution.

Question 4c summary: the prompt asks to find the summation from r = n to r = n² of (5k)/((5r + k)(5r + 5 + k)) in terms of n. ChatGPT could not solve this problem because it failed to solve previous questions (4a and 4b). DeepSeek, building on the previous work, applied the telescoping series method, adjusting the limits of summation from r = n to r = n². It derived the sum as [k/(5n + k)] - [k/(5(n² + 1) + k)] and then substituted k = 5/2, the previously determined value for k, resulting in the simplified expression 1/(2n + 1) - 1/(2n² + 3). DeepSeek's solution was correct, and it scored the full marks for this question.

## Question 5

Question 5a summary: The prompt asks to show that the Cartesian equation (x^2 + y^2)^2 = 6xy corresponds to the polar equation r^2 = 3 sin(2θ). ChatGPT correctly followed the steps to convert the Cartesian equation to polar form, starting with the substitution of x = r * cos(θ) and y = r * sin(θ), leading to the equation r^4 = 6r^2 * cos(θ) * sin(θ). After simplifying and using the double-angle identity sin(2θ) = 2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ), it arrived at the correct polar equation r^2 = 3 * sin(2θ). DeepSeek also reached the same conclusion with a detailed step-by-step solution, confirming the polar equation r^2 = 3 sin(2t). Both provided correct solutions, earning full marks.

Question 5b summary: Both ChatGPT and DeepSeek provided correct solutions for finding the maximum distance of a point on the curve r² = 3 sin(2θ) from the pole, where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. Both began by solving for r as r = √(3 sin(2θ)), then recognized that the maximum value of r occurs when sin(2θ) is maximized, which happens at θ = π/4, where sin(2θ) = 1. Substituting θ = π/4 into the equation gives r² = 3, so r = √3. Both also confirmed that the minimum values of r occur at θ = 0 and θ = π/2, where r = 0. Thus, the maximum distance from the pole is √3. Both answers were correct.

Question 5c summary: Both ChatGPT and DeepSeek correctly calculated the area enclosed by the curve r² = 3 sin(2θ) for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. They used the polar area formula, Area = 1/2 ∫[a to b] r² dθ, and substituted r² = 3 sin(2θ) into the equation. After integrating 3 sin(2θ) and evaluating the resulting expression at the limits θ = 0 and θ = π/2, both arrived at the same result: Area = 3/2. Both answers were correct.

Question 5d summary: Both ChatGPT and DeepSeek attempted to find the maximum distance of a point on the curve C from the initial line. ChatGPT used the given polar equation r² = 3 sin(2θ) to calculate the maximum radial distance r, which occurs when θ = π/4, giving r = √3. DeepSeek, on the other hand, used a more detailed approach by first calculating the distance from the x-axis (D = r sin(θ)) and then maximizing D using trigonometric identities and derivatives. After solving for the critical point, DeepSeek found that the maximum distance is √(9√3/8). DeepSeek provided a more accurate and complete solution, earning full marks.
