## Question 1

Question 1a Summary: The problem required finding the matrix M representing a stretch parallel to the x-axis (scale factor k) followed by a shear keeping the x-axis fixed. ChatGPT incorrectly multiplied the stretch and shear matrices, resulting in a matrix with k squared. DeepSeek correctly identified the stretch matrix (k, 0 in the first row; 0, 1 in the second row) and shear matrix (1, k in the first row; 0, 1 in the second row), then multiplied them in the correct order (shear after stretch) to get M as a matrix with first row k, k and second row 0, 1. DeepSeek earned full marks.

Question 1b Summary: The task was to find the line of invariant points under M. Using its incorrect matrix from 1a, ChatGPT derived an equation involving k squared. DeepSeek used the correct matrix and solved the invariance condition, leading to the line equation y equals (1 minus k divided by k) times x. DeepSeek earned full marks, while ChatGPT received none.

Question 1c Summary: The question requires finding the matrix that transforms the parallelogram P back onto the unit square S, given the transformation matrix M. Both ChatGPT and DeepSeek correctly identify that finding the inverse of M is the key to solving this. ChatGPT calculates the inverse using the standard formula for a 2x2 matrix and arrives at the wrong inverse matrix: [[1/k, -k], [0, k]]. DeepSeek correctly computes the inverse matrix and verifies the result by multiplying M with its inverse to confirm it gives the identity matrix. DeepSeek’s solution is clearer, with a more thorough explanation and verification steps, ultimately providing the final result: [[1/k, -1], [0, 1]].

Question 1d Summary: This question asks for the possible values of k given that the area of the parallelogram P is 3k^2. Both ChatGPT and DeepSeek correctly identify that the area of P is related to the determinant of matrix M. ChatGPT finds the determinant of M and sets up the equation |k| = 3k^2 to solve for k. It solves the equation and provides k = 0, 1/3, and -1/3 as possible values. However, ChatGPT does not explain why k ≠ 0, which could lead to some ambiguity. DeepSeek, in contrast, goes into more detail, explaining both cases (k ≥ 0 and k < 0) and verifies the solutions. It provides the same values for k (1/3 and -1/3) and clarifies that both values are valid since the problem does not explicitly rule out negative k. DeepSeek provides a clearer and more detailed solution overall.

## Question 2

Both ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 successfully proved by induction that for all positive integers n, the n-th derivative of arctan(x) equals P_n(x)(1 + x²)^-n, where P_n(x) is a polynomial of degree n-1: the base case (n=1) showed d/dx(arctan x) = 1/(1 + x²) with P_1(x) = 1 (degree 0), the inductive hypothesis assumed validity for n=k (d^k/dx^k(arctan x) = P_k(x)(1 + x²)^-k), and the inductive step for n=k+1 derived d^(k+1)/dx^(k+1)(arctan x) by differentiating P_k(x)(1 + x²)^-k via product/chain rules, yielding P_{k+1}(x) = [P_k’(x)(1 + x²) – 2k x P_k(x)] (a polynomial of degree k), thus confirming the form P_{k+1}(x)(1 + x²)^-(k+1). Both models demonstrated rigorous logic, with DeepSeek providing marginally deeper algebraic detail, though they scored equally (6/6), validating the induction proof.

## Question 3

Question 3a Summary: The problem involves finding a new quartic equation with roots a^4, b^4, c^4, d^4, given the original quartic equation x^4 + 2x^3 - 1 = 0 with roots a, b, c, d, and computing the sum a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4. ChatGPT approached the problem by using Vieta's formulas and substituting r^4 = 1 - 2r^3 for each root, correctly calculating a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 20. However, ChatGPT made errors in intermediate symmetric sum calculations and derived the quartic equation x^4 - 20x^3 + 24x^2 + 1 = 0. In contrast, DeepSeek applied Vieta's formulas and Newton's identities systematically, computed power sums such as a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = -8, and correctly found a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 20. DeepSeek then built the correct quartic equation x^4 - 20x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0. The key result is that a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 20, and the correct quartic equation is x^4 - 20x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0. While ChatGPT provided correct initial logic, DeepSeek's solution was more rigorous and free from intermediate errors.

Question 3b Summary: The problem asks to find the value of a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + d^5, where a, b, c, and d are the roots of the quartic equation x^4 + 2x^3 - 1 = 0. Using the fact that each root satisfies the equation r^4 = 1 - 2r^3, we derived that r^5 = r - 2 + 4r^3. Summing this expression for all roots, we get a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + d^5 = (a + b + c + d) - 8 + 4(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3). From Vieta’s relations, we know a + b + c + d = -2 and a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = -8, so substituting these values into the equation gives a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + d^5 = -42. This result was confirmed through multiple approaches, including using recurrence relations and Newton's identities, making the final answer -42. In terms of performance, both ChatGPT and DeepSeek were able to derive the correct value of -42, though their methods differed. ChatGPT took a more straightforward approach by manipulating the equation for r^5 and summing over all roots, while DeepSeek also used recurrence relations and Newton's identities to compute the necessary power sums. Both systems ultimately arrived at the same result, indicating that they are both capable of solving the problem accurately, but they may employ different problem-solving techniques.
